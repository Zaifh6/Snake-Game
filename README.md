## About The Project

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game brought to life using Python's `turtle` graphics library. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts, including real-time game mechanics, object-oriented programming (OOP), and file handling for saving and loading game scores. Players control a snake as it navigates the screen, grows in size by eating food, and aims to achieve the highest score possible.

### Features

- Classic Snake Game mechanics with smooth animations and responsive controls
- Graphical representation and user interactions managed through the `turtle` library
- Integration of file handling to save and load high scores
- Utilization of higher-order functions and OOP principles for modular and maintainable code
- Dynamic game state management to handle snake movement, collision detection, and scoring
- Simple and intuitive interface for an engaging gaming experience

### Built With

* **Python** – The programming language used to implement the core functionality and game logic.
* **Turtle** – The graphics library for creating the visual elements and handling user interactions.
* **File Handling** – For saving and loading high scores to persist game data.
* **Higher-Order Functions** – Employed to streamline game logic and event handling.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – For organizing code with classes and objects, enhancing code clarity and extensibility.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The `turtle` library comes bundled with Python.
