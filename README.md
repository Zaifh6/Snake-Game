<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Snake Game is an engaging and interactive application created using Python's Turtle graphics library. This project not only introduces fundamental game development concepts but also incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling to enhance functionality. Players navigate a snake to eat food and grow, while the game tracks and saves high scores, allowing for a persistent record of top performances.

### Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics with real-time gameplay and smooth animations
- Graphical representation and controls handled through Turtle
- Implementation of OOP principles for cleaner and more modular code
- High score tracking with file handling to save and retrieve best scores
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Use this `README.md` to get started and explore the code!

### Built With

* **Python** – A versatile programming language used to handle the core functionality.
* **Tkinter** – The standard GUI toolkit for Python, used to build the graphical interface.
* **File Handling** – For saving and loading high scores to preserve player achievements.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – To structure the game code with classes and objects, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
